Assignment: Search Dojo
Let's create a small application which searches through a text and collects the findings! The user types regular expressions into the search field.

Create the form seen below

Create a 'Search' button which uses the regular expression (entered by user as a text) from the 'Pattern' text field and collects the matches from the 'Text' listbox and shows it in the 'Matched' listbox.

Submit the GitHub repository link which contains your project source code.
